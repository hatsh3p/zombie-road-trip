# zombie-road-trip

A collaboration.

## TODO

* [ ] Check-in several CSV files full of "city path" tuple-things.
* [ ] Write a CSV parser that reads the files as `Path` objects.
* [ ] Write an undirected weighted graph `interface Graph<T>`.
* [ ] Write an undirected weighted graph implementation.
* [ ] Write a command-line input/processor (which file, corgo #s).
* [ ] Write the shortest path solver `interface`.
* [ ] Write a find the shortest path algorithm(s).
* [ ] Upgrade that algorithm to accept Corgo modifications.
* [ ] Visualize the city/graph with zombie counts in CLI.
* [ ] Display the resulting path, processing time, total zombie count.
* [ ] Display where the Corgo(s) were applied + zombies obliterated.
